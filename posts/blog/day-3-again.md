<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Did day 3 of the JS30 course and some Hackerrank problems.
<!-- Excerpt End -->
Day 3 was about Javascript variables. It wasn't anything new or crazy since I develop with SASS anyway, but I didn't know that Javascript had added variables until today (Learned something!)
I also completed 3 of the problems in Hackerrank's Interview Preparation sets since the lesson didn't take too long.
