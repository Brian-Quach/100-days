<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Nothing crazy today, I was able to connect the todo list and the timer of my Pomodoro app using the event emitters that I set up on Tuesday.
<!-- Excerpt End -->
Still having trouble getting stuff to rerender properly as they're updated. This is likely because I used an instance of class as a component Prop, so Stencil isn't really picking up the changes. I'll work on this next time! (And hopefully finish this project)
