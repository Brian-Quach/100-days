<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Day 4 of JS30 was about arrays and how you can sort/filter them. 
<!-- Excerpt End -->
It was a pretty good refresher and while I'm aware of what you can do with them, I have a habit of jumping straight to loops. I'll probably try use these methods a lot more on a regular basis.
