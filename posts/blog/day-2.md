Day two! Today I focused on trying to make this blog thing pretty. I learned a bunch about SASS in the process.
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Yikers, making stuff look pretty is hard. In an effort to do things the "correct way," I spent some time trying to figure out how to structure the SCSS files in this project. This led me to read all about the [7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) for Sass. This is supposed to be the accepted way of creating maintainable and scalable Sass code. As someone who works with Sass regularly, this was new to me. While it was actually pretty easy to get it set up thanks to a boilerplate that I found on GitHub, understanding where my code was supposed to go was another beast. Basic styling ended up taking a hell of a lot longer than expected, but I ended up with something that I'm happy *enough* with for now.
