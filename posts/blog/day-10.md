Learned about Clip Paths and got a lot more comfortable with Grid today.

After like 3 days of playing around with CSS Grid, I think I'm getting the hang of it. It's actually pretty useful. I also learned how to make [Notch Boxes](https://css-tricks.com/notched-boxes/), which lets me set up the geometric shapes of a Pokedex. Still needs a bit of work, but it's taking shape!! :)
