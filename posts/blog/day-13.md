<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Created a server for the socket chat application using ExpressJs.
<!-- Excerpt End -->
Today I set up a basic Express server to host the chat rooms for the chat app. I then started working on an class on the front-end that will eventually manage all of the communication stuff for the chat room. I managed to get the app to join a room using a nickname, and send a message. Next up - add the ability to recieve messages and display them.
