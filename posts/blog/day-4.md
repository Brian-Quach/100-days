<!-- Excerpt Start -->
This is another one of those things that I use *all* the time and took for granted. Turns out they're pretty cool.

Events listeners are pretty common is JS, whether it's listening for a click on a button, or listening for a change in an input value. I was working on my Pomodoro app again and ran into issues bridging the gap between the two seperates components of it - the timer, and the todo list. To solve this, I learned about event emitters, then implemented some basic ones for when the timer ended, and for when a task was completed. All that's left to do is to put it all together and we're good to go :)
Todays session was on the short end on account of a work social, but day 4 and we're still going strong. (Yay!)
