<!-- Excerpt Start -->
So I came across this thing on Twitter called the #100DaysOfCode challenge and I figured I'd take a stab at it.
<!-- Excerpt End -->
It's pretty simple, two rules.
1) Code for at least an hour each day for 100 days
2) Tweet your progress with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag 

Being absolutely incompetent when it comes to social media, I'll probably skip the latter more often than not. But this 100 day thing sounds like fun. 

Before starting this challenge, I needed a way to document my progress. While a github readme probably would have worked, This is about challenging myself and stepping out of my comfort zone. Hence the whole diving into static site generators. Today I started a git repository for this project, installed 11ty, and created a basic blog with it. 

Anyways, I'm super hyped about this challenge. Can't wait to get started.
