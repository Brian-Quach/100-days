<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Opps, kinda got lazy :(
<!-- Excerpt End -->
So I sorta got lazy and didn't code on Friday and over the weekend, so I'm starting over. Today I worked a bit on my chat app, and did Day of of Wes Bos' [Javascript 30 course](https://javascript30.com/). I'm hoping that a bunch of mini projects rather than a few bigger ones make it easier to stay motivated, as I'll be working on something new each day.
