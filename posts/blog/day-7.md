<!-- Excerpt Start -->
I think that the biggest issue that I am currently facing in this challenge is just not knowing what I want to work on.
<!-- Excerpt End -->
This has resulted in me spending more time than necessary trying to come up with an idea, and taking less time actually coding. Today I spent some time coming up with a list of about 20 mini-projects so that I can just grab one of those and start working should I get struck with "coder's block" in the future. I also created a Codepen account, so I can just jump straight into coding rather than spending time setting up my environment.

The project that I'll be working on over the weekend is a Pokedex using the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/). I spent some time doodling on my notebook to get an idea of what I want it to look like, and began to code the front end structure. I plan on taking this opportunity to try using CSS for the first time. Let's hope it goes well!
