So the first thing I worked on was a simple Pokedex built using PokeAPI and HTML. This was done on Codepen since it was a single page, and pretty simple. It is able to search for any Pokemon by its number and display the Name, Type, Height and Weight. Take a look at it over [here](https://codepen.io/briiquach/live/3af8cf5ad3d4031ff2b337e969ab97a7)!

Things that I learned through this included:
1) Got familiar with PokeAPI
2) Basic usage of CSS Grid
3) Learned how to use clip-path to draw basic shapes
